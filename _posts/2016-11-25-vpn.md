Today’s Friday Hack is about Security. Yes. With the increasing amount of concern over privacy and security over the internet, more and more people are starting to use a Virtual Private Network or VPN. VPNs offer a lot of interesting features such as privacy, encrypting your information, changing your IP, among other things.

The following video explains the advantages and disadvantages of the top 3 paid VPN services: Private Internet Access vs NordVPN vs ExpressVPN

Given that today is “Black Friday”, some of these companies have very interesting promo codes, so we decided to give [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) a try since it is offering a very good deal. The service is not free, but your security and your privacy comes at a cost these days. If you do not want to pay for a VPN, and you are ok with letting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Google know everything about you, then it is up to you.

Personally, I think we should start moving towards being more concerned about our privacy and security. So, we configured NordVPN for both Ubuntu and Android. If you are interested, the Ubuntu installation tutorial is found [here](https://nordvpn.com/tutorials/linux/openvpn/), and the Android installation tutorial is [here](https://nordvpn.com/download/android/)
